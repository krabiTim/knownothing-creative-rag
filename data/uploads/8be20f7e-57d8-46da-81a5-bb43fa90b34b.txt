# THE DIGITAL ARTIST
## A Short Film Script

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. CITY STREET - DAY**

Maya, a young digital artist in her 20s, walks through a bustling street carrying a worn laptop bag. Her eyes scan the urban landscape, looking for inspiration.

**MAYA (V.O.)**
Every artist faces the blank canvas. But what happens when the canvas is infinite... and empty?

**INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

A cramped studio apartment. Digital art prints cover the walls. Maya sits before her computer, cursor blinking on an empty digital canvas.

**MAYA**
(frustrated)
Come on... something. Anything.

She closes her laptop in defeat.

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - NEXT DAY**

Maya sits alone, sketching in a notebook. ALEX (30s), a tech researcher, approaches.

**ALEX**
Mind if I sit? That's beautiful work.

**MAYA**
(looking up)
Oh, thanks. Just trying to find my voice.

**ALEX**
What if I told you there was a way to amplify that voice?

Alex pulls out a tablet showing an AI art collaboration tool.

**ALEX (CONT'D)**
This isn't about replacing creativity. It's about understanding it, expanding it.

**MAYA**
(intrigued)
Show me.

**MONTAGE - MAYA AND AI COLLABORATION**

- Maya uploads her sketches
- The AI analyzes her style, color preferences
- Together, they create something neither could achieve alone
- Maya's confidence grows with each iteration

**INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER**

Maya's apartment is transformed. New artworks line the walls. She works confidently, the AI as her creative partner.

**MAYA (V.O.)**
The blank canvas isn't empty anymore. It's full of possibility.

**FADE OUT.**
