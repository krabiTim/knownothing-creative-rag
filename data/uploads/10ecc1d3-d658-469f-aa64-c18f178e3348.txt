# THE DRAGON'S APPRENTICE
## Fantasy Adventure Script

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. MYSTICAL MOUNTAINS - DAWN**

Young LYRA (16) practices magic in a hidden grove. Her spells fail repeatedly, sparks fizzling into smoke. She throws down her crystal wand in frustration.

**LYRA**
Why can't I get this right? Every other apprentice in the kingdom has mastered basic magic by now.

**ELDER SAGE (O.S.)**
Magic isn't about power, child. It's about understanding the connection between all living things.

ELDER SAGE emerges from the mist, his robes shimmering with starlight.

**ELDER SAGE (CONT'D)**
Your grandmother was the same way. Impatient. But when she finally understood...

He gestures, and the entire grove blooms with ethereal light.

**LYRA**
Tell me about her magic. Tell me about the old ways.

**MONTAGE - LEARNING THE OLD MAGIC**

- Lyra learns to listen to the whispers of ancient trees
- She practices channeling energy through crystal formations
- Her magic grows stronger through emotional connection, not force
- She befriends a wounded dragon, healing it with compassionate magic

**INT. CRYSTAL CAVERN - CLIMAX**

The SHADOW SORCERER threatens to destroy the realm's magic forever. Lyra faces him, no longer the uncertain apprentice.

**LYRA**
You're wrong about magic. It doesn't come from domination or fear. It comes from love, connection, and understanding.

She combines her crystal magic with the dragon's ancient power, creating a shield of pure light that restores balance to the realm.

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END**
