# THE DIGITAL CANVAS
## A Short Film Script

**FADE IN:**

**INT. MAYA'S STUDIO - NIGHT**

MAYA (25), a digital artist, sits before glowing monitors. Her artwork fills the main screen.

**MAYA**
(frustrated)
Why does this feel empty?

She deletes hours of work.

**ALEX (V.O.)**
Sometimes the best art comes from destroying what doesn't serve you.

**MAYA**
Easy for you to say, Alex. You're already successful.

Maya begins to paint with bold, expressive strokes.

**MONTAGE - CREATIVE BREAKTHROUGH**

- Maya experiments with color and light
- Her art evolves from rigid to fluid
- Connection replaces perfection

**INT. GALLERY - ONE MONTH LATER**

Maya's artwork fills the walls.

**MAYA**
Thank you for reminding me that art is about feeling, not just technique.

**FADE OUT.**

**THE END**
