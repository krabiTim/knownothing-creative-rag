This is a comprehensive test document for Stage 5 of the knowNothing Creative RAG system.

It contains creative content about storytelling, character development, and artistic techniques.

The document includes multiple paragraphs to test text chunking and embedding generation.

This content will be used to verify that semantic search can find relevant information based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

Creative writing involves understanding narrative structure, character motivation, and thematic elements that resonate with audiences.

🎉 STAGE 5 IMPLEMENTATION:
✅ Embedding service with sentence-transformers
✅ ChromaDB vector database integration
✅ Semantic search API endpoints
✅ Document chunking and processing
✅ Statistics and monitoring

🧪 TESTING RESULTS:
✅ Passed: $PASSED_TESTS/$TOTAL_TESTS tests
🎯 Status: $STAGE5_STATUS

🔧 TECHNICAL FEATURES:
• /api/embeddings/stats - Service statistics
• /api/embeddings/embed/{id} - Create embeddings
• /api/search/semantic - Meaning-based search
• Lazy loading for performance
• Artist-friendly error messages

🎨 ARTIST BENEFITS:
• Search by meaning, not just keywords
• Find similar content across documents
• Automatic text processing
• No technical knowledge required
